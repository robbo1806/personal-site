A personal website solely developed by me. On this website, I have links to projects that I have been working on whilst also attempting to incorporate new skills into the website itself.
Created in May 2024 it is currently extremely basic but in a few months, I hope to have a sleek, professional-looking website.
All feedback is welcome!
